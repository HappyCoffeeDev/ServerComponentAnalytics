Usage
Once you have installed the ServerComponentAnalytics package, you can start using it to optimize your for loops. Below is a basic usage example:

python
Copy code
from ServerComponentAnalytics import optimize_for_loop

def example_function():
    for i in range(1000000):
        pass

optimized_function = optimize_for_loop(example_function)
optimized_function()
Configuration Options
You can configure various options to customize the optimization process. Here is an example with configuration options:

python
Copy code
optimized_function = optimize_for_loop(
    example_function,
    unroll_factor=4,
    use_parallel_execution=True,
    cache_optimization=True
)
Detailed Configuration Parameters
unroll_factor (int): Specifies the loop unrolling factor. Default is 2.
use_parallel_execution (bool): Enables parallel execution of loop iterations. Default is False.
cache_optimization (bool): Enables cache optimization. Default is False.
Examples
Example 1: Basic Loop Optimization
python
Copy code
from ServerComponentAnalytics import optimize_for_loop

def basic_loop():
    for i in range(1000):
        print(i)

optimized_basic_loop = optimize_for_loop(basic_loop)
optimized_basic_loop()
Example 2: Advanced Loop Optimization
python
Copy code
from ServerComponentAnalytics import optimize_for_loop

def advanced_loop(data):
    for item in data:
        process(item)

optimized_advanced_loop = optimize_for_loop(
    advanced_loop,
    unroll_factor=8,
    use_parallel_execution=True
)
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
optimized_advanced_loop(data)
Optimization Techniques
Loop Unrolling
Loop unrolling is a technique used to reduce the number of iterations in a loop by executing multiple iterations within a single loop iteration. This can significantly improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with loop control.

Parallel Execution
Parallel execution allows multiple iterations of a loop to be executed simultaneously on different CPU cores. This can greatly improve performance for CPU-bound tasks by utilizing the full computational power of a multi-core processor.

Cache Optimization
Cache optimization techniques improve data locality and reduce cache misses by ensuring that frequently accessed data is stored in the CPU cache. This can lead to significant performance improvements for memory-bound tasks.

Advanced Configuration
Custom Optimization Strategies
You can define custom optimization strategies by subclassing the OptimizationStrategy class and implementing the optimize method. Here is an example:

python
Copy code
from ServerComponentAnalytics import OptimizationStrategy

class CustomOptimizationStrategy(OptimizationStrategy):
    def optimize(self, function):
        # Custom optimization logic
        pass

custom_strategy = CustomOptimizationStrategy()
optimized_function = custom_strategy.optimize(example_function)
Integration with Other Libraries
ServerComponentAnalytics can be integrated with other libraries such as NumPy and Pandas to optimize for loops within these libraries. Here is an example:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from ServerComponentAnalytics import optimize_for_loop

def numpy_loop(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i] = arr[i] * 2

optimized_numpy_loop = optimize_for_loop(numpy_loop)
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
optimized_numpy_loop(arr)
